License:   GPL-3.0+ with exception
 As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
 part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
 parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
 as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
 the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
 special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
 Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
 License without this special exception.

  use of those files for a purpose other than building the collector may
  require the resulting code to be covered by the GPL.

License: Allegro giftware license
  Allegro is gift-ware. It was created by a number of people working in
  cooperation, and is given to you freely as a gift. You may use, modify,
  redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like, and you do
  not have to give us anything in return.

  However, if you like this product you are encouraged to thank us by making
  a return gift to the Allegro community. This could be by writing an add-on
  package, providing a useful bug report, making an improvement to the
  library, or perhaps just releasing the sources of your program so that
  other people can learn from them. If you redistribute parts of this code or
  make a game using it, it would be nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere
  in the credits, but you are not required to do this. We trust you not to
  abuse our generosity.
