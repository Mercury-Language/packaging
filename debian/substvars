about-mercury=Mercury is a logic/functional programming language which combines the${Newline}clarity and expressiveness of declarative programming with advanced static${Newline}analysis and error detection features.${Newline}${Newline}Its highly optimized execution algorithm delivers efficiency far in excess${Newline}of existing logic programming systems, and close to conventional${Newline}programming systems.  Mercury addresses the problems of large-scale program${Newline}development, allowing modularity, separate compilation, and numerous${Newline}optimization/time trade-offs.
