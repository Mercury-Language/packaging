<h1>Mercury packages for .deb based systems</h1>

<p>
Please <a href="https://github.com/Mercury-Language/packaging/issues">
let us know</a> if there are problems.
<p>

<h2>What's supported?</h2>
<p>
Currently packages for Mercury 14.01.1 on Debian jessie (oldstable) and
stretch (stable) on amd64 and i386, and Mercury ROTD 2018-11-14 on Debian
stretch (amd64 only).
</p>
<p>
You might find that even if you don't have the exact Debian version I've
built the packages for they work anyway.  Mercury has few dependencies so
this is quite likely.  For example the Debian jessie packages work on my
Mint desktop.
</p>
<p>
The packaged version of Mercury contains a reasonable number of grades for
the C backends.  It does not contain the Java, C# or Erlang backends.
The included grades are.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>asm_fast.gc</li>
  <li>asm_fast.par.gc.stseg</li>
  <li>asm_fast.gc.trseg</li>
  <li>hlc.gc</li>
  <li>hlc.par.gc</li>
  <li>hlc.gc.trseg</li>
  <li>asm_fast.gc.decldebug.stseg</li>
  <li>asm_fast.gc.profdeep.stseg</li>
  <li>asm_fast.gc.memprof.stseg</li>
  <li>asm_fast.gc.prof.stseg</li>
</ul>

<p>
Depending on the C compiler some packages use "reg" grades rather than
"asm_fast" grades.
</p>

<p>
There are two groups of packages to choose from.
The stable version of Mercury's packages begin with "mercury", a more recent
snapshot begins with "mercury-rotd".
</p>

<p>
This Mercury has been bootstrapped (the compiler is built with 3 tag bits
and other settings) and separated into multiple packages.
It does not support multiple concurrent installation versions, nor do the
dynamic libraries support this.
As always, make sure that there is no other version of Mercury in your
<code>$PATH</code>, you can run into 
<a href="https://bugs.mercurylang.org/view.php?id=433">problems</a>.
</p>

<h2>Okay, hook me up!</h2>

<p>
First download <a href="https://paul.bone.id.au/paul.asc">my GPG key</a> and
tell your Debian based system that you trust me.
This command means that you are authorising your computer to download any
software I publish in this repository, like Debian itself.
</p>

<code><pre>
cd /tmp
wget <a href="https://paul.bone.id.au/paul.asc">https://paul.bone.id.au/paul.asc</a>
sudo apt-key add paul.asc
</pre></code>

<p>
Now tell your system where the repository is.
Create a new file in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d</code>, name it
<code>mercury.list</code> and paste in it:
</p>

<code><pre>
deb http://dl.mercurylang.org/deb/ <i>DISTRO</i> main
deb-src http://dl.mercurylang.org/deb/ <i>DISTRO</i> main
</pre></code>

<p>
Replace <i>DISTRO</i> with either <code>jessie</code> or
<code>stretch</code> depending on your OS version:
</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>You have</th><th>Then use</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Debian 8 (jessie)</td><td>jessie</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Debian 9 (stretch)</td><td>stretch</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial)</td><td>jessie</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic)</td><td>stretch</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Mint 18</td><td>jessie</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Mint 19</td><td>stretch</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
If your OS version isn't listed,
then try the jessie packages first, they use the faster low-level-C grades
but require gcc-4.8 specifically.
</p>

<p>
Update your packages list.
</p>

<code><pre>
sudo apt-get update
</pre></code>

<p>
Either browse the packages or install
<code>mercury-recommended</code> which will install a reasonable set of
Mercury packages for most developers.
</p>

<code><pre>
sudo apt install mercury-recommended
</pre></code>

or for a recent ROTD version of Mercury:

<code><pre>
sudo apt install mercury-rotd-recommended
</pre></code>

<p>
Or choose specific packages to install.  You can see a list with the
command:
</p>

<code><pre>
apt-cache showsrc mercury
</pre></code>
